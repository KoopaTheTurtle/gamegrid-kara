# GameGridKara

GameGridKara is a combination of the mini-world [Kara](http://www.swisseduc.ch/compscience/karatojava/index.html) and the [JGameGrid](http://www.aplu.ch/home/apluhomex.jsp?site=45) library to teach introductory programming in Java. All scenarios can be used with any IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans or BlueJ.

For more on Kara see these [resources in German](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/).

## Why GameGrid and Kara?
The concept of Kara has proven itself over years for motivating beginning programmers. Kara is a programmable ladybug, who lives in a simple graphical world and must solve problems of varying difficulty, for example, collect leafs or find his way through a labyrinth.

JGameGrid is a class library that can be used to create a game playground based on grid cells. JGameGrid is inspired by [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org/) but can be used with a single `.jar` which would not be possible with Greenfoot.

With JGameGrid we can provide visual and interactive Kara scenarios and program in any IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans or BlueJ.
